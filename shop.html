				<p>Our facility includes a variety of naturally made soaps with no fragrances or colors. This category also includes soaps made with lard or tallow. They contains higher omega-7, omega-9, conjugated linoleic acid, and vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12 than plant-based fats â€“ all these are essential to radiant, healthy skin. They are stable fats that produce rich, creamy lather with nice cleansing properties. They also make for nice, hard bars that won't melt away in the shower.</p>

We make multi-layered bars, dessert style soaps, and XXL manly-hands soap...meaning they would take two hands for me to use them. LOL! Okay, maybe not that big but they are much larger than our standard 4-6oz designs.</p>
